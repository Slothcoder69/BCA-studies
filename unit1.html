            <li>
                <strong>Data Structre:- </strong>
                
                is a particular way of organizing data in a computer memory(cache, main, secondary) so that
                memory can be used efficently both in terms of time and space.
            </li>
            
            <li>
               <span>-></span> It is a logical relationship existing between individual elements of data, it considers elements stored and also
                their relationship to each toher</li>
            </p>
            <p>Data structre mainly specifies the following four things:-</p>
            <li>1. Organisation of Data</li>
            <li>2. Accessing methods</li>
            <li>3. Degree of association</li>
            <li>4. Processing methods</li>
        <h3><strong>Effect of Data Structre: -</strong></h3>
        <p>
            <li>Data structre effect both the structural and functional aspects of the program</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            <li>Different kind of Data structres are suited to different kind of applications, and some highly specified to
                specific tasks, For example.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Relational databases commonly use B-tree indexed for data retrieval</li>
                <li>Compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers</li>
            </p>
        </div>
            <span>Ans.</span>Data Structure are grouped into two main categories: primitve and non-primitive
            <br>
            <img src="ds.png" alt="">
           <li><span class="red">Primitve Data Structure: </span>Primtive data structures are the basic data structres that directly operate the machine instructions</li>
           <li>It is a basic data structre which is avaialable in most of the programming languages. it includes integer, float, char and boolean </li>
           <li><span class="red">Non-Primitive Data Structure: </span>Non-primitve data structures are more complicated data structures and are derived from primitive data structre.</li>
        <li>Non primitive data structure can be divided into two types:- <br>
           Linear data structure <br>Non Linear data structure</li>
          <li><span class="red">Linear data structure:</span> Linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially.</li>
          <li><span>In linear data structure only one data element can be reached directly it includes arrays, linked list, stack and queue</li></span>
          <li><span>Array:</span>
            An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a contiguous block of memory
        </li>
        <li> Arrays are indexed, meaning that each item in the array has a unique index that can be used to access it</li>
        <li><span >Linked list:</span>A linked list is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a non-contiguous block of memory.</li>
        <li>Each item in a linked list contains a pointer to the next item in the list.</li>
        <li><span>Stack:</span> A stack is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a LIFO (last in, first out) order</li>
        <li><span>Queue</span>A queue is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a FIFO (first in, first out) order.</li>
       </p>
       <li><span class="red">Non-linear data structure: </span>In non-linear data structure, the data values are not arranged in order and data item is connected to several other data times </li> 
       <li>free contiguous memory is not required for allocating data items</li>
       <li><span>it includes trees and graphs</span></li>
       <li><span>Tree:</span>: A tree is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a hierarchical order.</li>
       <li>Each item in a tree has a parent item and zero or more child items</li>
       <li><span>Graph:</span> A graph is a data structure that stores a collection of items and the relationships between them</li>
       <li> Graphs are efficient for storing and accessing data that is interconnected.</li>
