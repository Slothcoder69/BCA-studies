    <h1>Stacks and Queues</h1>
    <p><span>Stack:</span> A stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last in, First out) or FILO (First in, Last out). It allows adding and removing elements in a particular order. Examples include a deck of cards, a pile of plates, etc.</p>
    <p>It has two main operations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Push: Adds an element to the collection.</li>
        <li>Pop: Removes the most recently added element.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a detailed explanation and program, refer to <a href="stack.cpp">this link</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>What is a stack in detail:</h2>
    <p>A stack is a linear data structure that holds a linear, ordered sequence of elements. It is an abstract data type. A stack works on the LIFO process (Last In First Out), i.e., the element that was inserted last will be removed first.</p>

    <h2>Operations on Stacks:</h2>
    <p>An operation on a stack typically refers to one of the fundamental actions you can perform on a data structure known as a stack. A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.</li>
        <li>Pop: Removes the top element from the stack.</li>
        <li>Peek (or Top): Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.</li>
        <li>isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.</li>
        <li>isFull: Checks if the stack is full (relevant for implementations with a fixed size).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a program on stack operations, refer to <a href="operationstack.cpp">this link</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Stack Implementation:</h2>
    <p>A stack can be implemented using both static data structures (array) and dynamic data structures (linked list).</p>
    <p><span>Array Implementation:</span> In this implementation, a fixed-size array is used to store the elements of the stack. The top of the stack is represented by an index variable.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advantages: Simple implementation, constant time access to elements.</li>
        <li>Disadvantages: Limited size, resizing the array can be expensive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>Linked List Implementation:</span> In this implementation, a linked list is used where each node contains a data element and a pointer to the next node.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advantages: Dynamic size, efficient memory usage.</li>
        <li>Disadvantages: Slightly more complex implementation, memory overhead for storing pointers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Applications of a stack</h3>
    <p><li><span>Function Call Management:</span>Stacks are widely used in programming languages to manage function calls. When a function is called, its parameters and local variables are pushed onto the stack, and when the function returns, they are popped off the stack.</li>
    <li><span>Memory Management:</span> Stacks are essential in managing memory in computer systems. The call stack, for instance, is used to keep track of the execution of programs, including function calls and returns.</li></p>
    <p>Representing expressions using stacks is a common technique, especially in converting between different notations (e.g., infix to postfix). <br> Here's how expressions can be represented using stacks: <br>

        Infix Expression: <br>
        In infix notation, operators are placed between operands. <br> For example, 2 + 3 * 4. <br>
        Postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) Expression: <br>
        In postfix notation, operators come after their operands. <br> For example, the postfix equivalent of 2 + 3 * 4 is 2 3 4 * +. <br>
        Prefix (Polish Notation) Expression: <br>
        In prefix notation, operators precede their operands.  <br>For example, the prefix equivalent of 2 + 3 * 4 is + 2 * 3 4.</p>
