        1.Define Data structures? Explain the characteristics and uses of data structures?
        <p class="answer">
            <span>Ans.</span> A data structre is a way of organising and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficently.
            <li>Data strucutre is desgined to organise data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accesed and worked within appropriate ways</li>
            <li>It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as well as the implementation in a computer program</li>
            <span>Example:-</span>
            <li>Queues: A linear data structure that follows the FIFO order</li>
        </p>
        <p class="answer"><h3>Important characteristics of data structre are;-</h3>
            <li><span>Correctness-</span>Data structre implemntation should implement its interface correctly </li>
            <li><span>Time Complexity-</span>
            Running time or the the execution time of operation of data structre must be as small as possible</li>
            <li><span>Space Complexity-</span>Memory usage of data structre operation should be as little as possible</li>
        </p>
        <p class="answer"><h3>Uses Of Data Structre are:-</h3>
            <li>Data structre is used in almost every program or software system</li>
            <li>It helps to write efficent code, structres the code and solve problem</li>
            <li>Data can be maintained more easily by encouraging a better desgin or implementation</li>
            <li>Data structre is just a container for the data that is used to store, manipulate and arrange.It can be processed by algorithms</li>

        2.Explain the types of datastructures?
        <p class="answer">
            <span>Ans.</span>Data Structure are grouped into two main categories: primitve and non-primitive
            <br>
            <img src="ds.png" alt="">
           <li><span class="red">Primitve Data Structure: </span>Primtive data structures are the basic data structres that directly operate the machine instructions</li>
           <li>It is a basic data structre which is avaialable in most of the programming languages. it includes integer, float, char and boolean </li>
           <li><span class="red">Non-Primitive Data Structure: </span>Non-primitve data structures are more complicated data structures and are derived from primitive data structre.</li>
        <li>Non primitive data structure can be divided into two types:- <br>
           Linear data structure <br>Non Linear data structure</li>
          <li><span class="red">Linear data structure:</span> Linear data structure traverses the data elements sequentially.</li>
          <li><span>In linear data structure only one data element can be reached directly it includes arrays, linked list, stack and queue</li></span>
          <li><span>Array:</span>
            An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a contiguous block of memory
        </li>
        <li> Arrays are indexed, meaning that each item in the array has a unique index that can be used to access it</li>
        <li><span >Linked list:</span>A linked list is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a non-contiguous block of memory.</li>
        <li>Each item in a linked list contains a pointer to the next item in the list.</li>
        <li><span>Stack:</span> A stack is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a LIFO (last in, first out) order</li>
        <li><span>Queue</span>A queue is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a FIFO (first in, first out) order.</li>
       </p>
       <li><span class="red">Non-linear data structure: </span>In non-linear data structure, the data values are not arranged in order and data item is connected to several other data times </li> 
       <li>free contiguous memory is not required for allocating data items</li>
       <li><span>it includes trees and graphs</span></li>
       <li><span>Tree:</span>: A tree is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a hierarchical order.</li>
       <li>Each item in a tree has a parent item and zero or more child items</li>
       <li><span>Graph:</span> A graph is a data structure that stores a collection of items and the relationships between them</li>
       <li> Graphs are efficient for storing and accessing data that is interconnected.</li>

        3.Define Array? Explain various types of array in detail?</p>
    <p class="answer">
        <span>Ans. </span>An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items. It is used to store a collection of data, such as a list of numbers, names, or objects. <br> Arrays are often used to represent data that is related to each other, such as the items in a shopping cart or the students in a class.
        <li>The following types of arrays are:</li>
        <li><span>One dimensonal array:</span>A one-dimensional array is the simplest type of array. It is a list of items that are stored in a single row</li>
        <li>One-dimensional arrays are often used to store lists of numbers, names, or objects.</li>
        <li><span>Two-dimensional arrays:</span>A two-dimensional array is a list of lists. It is a table of items that are stored in rows and columns.</li>
        <li>Two-dimensional arrays are often used to store tables of data, such as a spreadsheet or a database table</li>
        <li><span>Multi-dimensional arrays:</span>A multi-dimensional array is an array that has more than two dimensions. </li>
        <li>Multi-dimensional arrays are often used to store complex data structures, such as a video game map or a 3D model.</li>

        4.Explain the advantages and disadvantages of arrays?
        <p class="answer">
           <span>Ans.</span><p></p> <span class="red">Advantages of arrays are</span>
            <li>In an array, accessing an element is very easy by using the index number.</li>
            <li>Arrays can be used to represent strings, stacks and queues</li>
            <li>Arrays are memory-efficient, as they store data in contiguous memory locations. This makes them easy to manipulate and efficient to use.</li>
            <li>Arrays are well known in applications such as searching, matrix operations and sorting</li>
            <li>For any reason a user wishes to store multiple values of similar type then the Array can be used and utilized efficiently.</li>
            <br>
            <span class="red">Disadvantages of array</span>
            <li>Fixed-size. The size of an array is fixed. Once the size is declared, it cannot be changed. ...</li>
            <li>Lack of flexibility. Arrays are not very flexible as they have a fixed size</li>
            <li>Overhead. When working with arrays, an overhead is involved in terms of time and memory.</li>
