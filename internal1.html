        1.Define Data structures? Explain the characteristics and uses of data structures?
        <p class="answer">
            <span>Ans.</span> A data structre is a way of organising and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used efficently.
            <li>Data strucutre is desgined to organise data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accesed and worked within appropriate ways</li>
            <li>It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as wellas the implemntation in a computer program</li>
            <span>Example:-</span>
            <li>Queues: A linear data structure that follows the FIFO order</li>
        </p>
        <p class="answer"><h3>Important characteristics of data structre are;-</h3>
            <li><span>Correctness-</span>Data structre implemntation should implement its interface correctly </li>
            <li><span>Time Complexity-</span>
            Running time or the the execution time of operation of data structre must be as small has possible</li>
            <li><span>Space Complexity-</span>Memory usage of data structre operation should be as little as possible</li>
        </p>
        <p class="answer"><h3>Uses Of Data Structre are:-</h3>
            <li>Data structre is used in almost every program or software system</li>
            <li>It helps to write efficent code, structress the code and solve problem</li>
            <li>Data can be maintained more easily by encouraging a better desgin or implemntation</li>
            <li>Data structre is just a container for the data that is used to store, manipulate and arrange.It can be processed by algorithms</li>

        2.Explain the types of datastructures?
        <p class="answer">
            Data Structure are grouped into two main categories: primitve and non-primitive
            <br>
            <img src="ds.png" alt="">
           <li><span class="red">Primitve Data Structre: </span>Primtive data structres are the basic data structres that directly operate the machine instructions</li>
           <li>It is a basic data structre which is avaialbe in most of the programming languages. it includes integre, float, character and boolean </li>
           <li><span class="red">Non-Primitive Data Structre: </span>Non-primitve data structres are more complicated data structres and are derived from primitive data structre.</li>
        <li>Non primitive data structre can be divided into two types:- <br>
           Linear data structre <br>Non Linear data structre</li>
          <li><span class="red">Linear data structre:</span> Linear data structre traverses the data elements sequentially.</li>
          <li><span>In linear data structre only one data element can be reached directly it includes arrays, linked list, stack and queue</li></span>
          <li><span>Array:</span>
            An array is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a contiguous block of memory
        </li>
        <li> Arrays are indexed, meaning that each item in the array has a unique index that can be used to access it</li>
        <li><span >Linked list:</span>A linked list is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a non-contiguous block of memory.</li>
        <li>Each item in a linked list contains a pointer to the next item in the list.</li>
        <li><span>Stack:</span> A stack is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a LIFO (last in, first out) order</li>
        <li><span>Queue</span>A queue is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a FIFO (first in, first out) order.</li>
       </p>
       <li><span class="red">Non-linear data structre: </span>In non-linear data structre, the data values are not arranged in order and data item is connected to several other data times </li> 
       <li>free contiguous memory is not required for allocating data items</li>
       <li><span>it includes trees and graphs</span></li>
       <li><span>Tree:</span>: A tree is a data structure that stores a collection of items in a hierarchical order.</li>
       <li>Each item in a tree has a parent item and zero or more child items</li>
       <li><span>Graph:</span> A graph is a data structure that stores a collection of items and the relationships between them</li>
       <li> Graphs are efficient for storing and accessing data that is interconnected.</li>
