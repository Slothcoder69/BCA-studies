    <p class="question">1. Darw and explain the block diagram of a simple computer <br> with 5 functional units?
        <p class="answer">
            <SPAN>ANS:</SPAN>
            <h4 class="img">Block diagram of a computer</h4><br>
            <img src="block diagram of a computer.png" alt="" height="400px" width="550px"><br>
            A basic computer architecture typically includes five primary functional units:

            <li><span>Input:</span>All the data received by the computer goes through the input unit. <br>The input unit comprises different devices like a mouse, keyboard, scanner, etc.</li>
            <li>In other words, each of these devices acts as a mediator between the users and the computer.</li>
            <li>The data that is to be processed is put through the input unit. The computer accepts the <br> raw data in binary form. It then processes the data and produces the desired output.</li>
            <li><span class="no">If u dont want to write the above points of input then</span></li>
            <p><span class="red">Main points of the input are:</span></p>
            <li>Take the data to be processed by the user.</li>
            <li>Convert the given data into machine-readable form.</li>
            <li>And then, transmit the converted data into the main memory of the computer. The sole <br> purpose is to connect the user and the computer. In addition, this creates easy communication between them.</li>
            <li><span>CPU - Central Processing Unit</span>CPU is the brain of the computer. It works <br> the same way a human brain works.</li>
            <li>The CPU is a hardware component responsible for carrying out instructions of a computer program by performing basic arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output operations</li>
            <li>Now the CPU comprises of two units, namely - ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and CU (Control Unit). <br> Both of these units work in sync. The CPU processes the data as a whole.</li>
            <li><span>CU - Control Unit</span>The memory unit sends a set of instructions to the control unit. Then <br>the control unit in turn converts those instructions. After that these instructions are converted to control signals.
            </li>
            <li>These control signals help in prioritizing and scheduling activities. Thus, the control unit <br>coordinates the tasks inside the computer in sync with the input and output units.</li>
            <li><span>Memory Unit</span>
                All the data that has to be processed or has been processed is stored in the memory unit. </li>
                <li>The memory unit acts as a hub of all the data. It transmits it to the required part of <br> the computer whenever necessary.</li>
                <li><span>There are two types of computer memory-</span></li>
                <li><span>Primary memory</span>his type of memory cannot store a vast amount of data. <br> Therefore, it is only used to store recent data</li>
                <li>The data stored in this is temporary. It can get erased once the power is switched <br> off.</li>
                <li><span>Secondary memory</span> As explained above, the primary memory stores temporary <br> data. Thus it cannot be accessed in the future.</li>
                <li>or permanent storage purposes, secondary memory is used. It is also called permanent memory <br> or auxiliary memory</li>
                <li><span>Output</span>There is nothing to be amazed by what the output unit is used for. All the <br> information sent to the computer once processed is received by the user through the output unit</li>

    <p class="question">2. Explain about bus structure?
        <p class="answer">
            <li>In computer architecture, a bus is a communication system that transfers data between components within a computer or between computers. It's also known as a data highway or databus</li>
        </p>
        <li>A bus structure is a set of conductors that carry data, address, and control signals within a computer system. It acts as a communication highway connecting the central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices, and other peripherals.</li>
        <li>A system bus usually consists of a range of distinct lines, typically numbering from fifty to hundreds. Each line is designated for a specific function, and these lines can be divided into three main functional categories: data lines, address lines, and control lines.</li>
        <li>Multiple components or devices can use the same bus structure to transmit information signals to each other. However, only one pair of devices can use the bus at a time to communicate successfully.</li>
        <li>Most computer have three busses:</li>
        <li>Control bus</li>
        <li>Data Bus</li>
        <li>Address Bus</li>

    <p class="question">3. Explain about memeory location and address?
        <p class="answer">
        <li><span>Memory location:-</span>
        Main memory is second major subsystem in a computer</li>
        <li>Data is transferred to and from memory in groups of bits called words</li>
        <li>The memory consists of many millions of storage cells, each of which can store a bit of information having value 0 or 1</li>
        <li>Bits are seldom handled individually. The usual approach is to deal with them in groups of fixed size</li>
        <li>Memory is organised so that a group of n bits can be stored or retrieved in a single, basic operation</li>
        <li>Each group of n bits is referred to as a word of information, and n is called the word length</li>
        <li>Modern computers have word lengths that typically range from 16 t6 64 bits</li>
        <span class="red">Each memory location has an address, and each address refers to a single memory location.
        </span>
        <h4>There are two types of memory addresses:</h4>
        <li>Physical addresses: These are codes that the CPU or other device can use to access the corresponding memory location.</li>
        <li>Logical addresses: These are virtual addresses that application programs use</li>

    <p class="question">4. Explain in detail about basic input output operations?
       
        <p class="answer"> Input/output (I/O) operations are a type of communication process in computing that involves transferring data between a computer and its external environment.
            <li>Input: Involves reading data from an external source into the computer's memory.
               </li> <li> This data can come from users' input devices, such as keyboards, mice, or touchscreens. <br> It can also come from other devices or sensors connected to the computer, such as scanners, cameras, or microphones.</li>
           <li> Basic Input Output System (BIOS): Handles input and output operations at a basic level. BIOS helps provide services to the operating system, <br> such as booting up and initializing of hardware</li>
           <li>I/O devices: Can be categorized as storage, networking, user interface, or related hardware-enabled services. <br> Some common I/O devices include printers, hard disks, keyboards, and mice.</li>
