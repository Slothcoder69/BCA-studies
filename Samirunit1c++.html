            The basic element used to costruct simple C++ Statements include the C++ character
            set, constructs, variables, identifiers and keywords, data types etc. 
            In this chapter we will see how these basic element can be combined to 
            form the statements of the program.
     
            A program must be able to store its input at some 
            place so that it can be

    <center><h2>GETTING STARTED WITH C++ LANGUAGE</h2></center>

    Language is a way of communication with each other. 
            words it is broadly defined as : Alphabets are combined to form words.
            words are combined as sentences. sentences are combined to paragraph, 
            and also rules and regulation are combined to form sentence.
            This whole combination is known as a language. A step by step procedure for 
            learning a language can also be shown as :

    C++ language is a way of communication with computer.
    It can be broadly defineed as : Alphabets, digits and keyword, whichc are further
    combined to form instruction or statement, rules and regulation i.e 
    grammer rules are also combined for instruction and instruction are further combined to form program.
    This whole combination is know as C++ language.
    So to learn C++ language, a step by step procedure can be shown as :

<br>
<article>
    1. Identifiers are the names given to variuos elements of program such as 
    variables, functions, constants, arrays, stucture, union, class, module or
    any user defined item.
    <br>
    2. It must start an alphabet or an underscore.
    <br>
    3. It must not start with a digit and must not contain any special symbol
    other than underscore.
