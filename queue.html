    <h2>Queue</h2>
    <p><span>Queue:</span>Is a non-primitive linear data structure that permits insertion of an element at one end and deletion of an element at other end. <br>
        The end at which the deletion of an
        element take place is called <span>front</span>, <br> and the end at which insertion of a new element can
        take place is called <span>rear</span></p>
        <p>The first element that gets added into the queue is the first one to get removed from the list. <br> Hence, Queue is also referred to as <span>First-In-First-Out (FIFO)</span></p>
        <p><span>Real life example</span>The name
            ‘Queue’ comes from the everyday use of the term. Consider a railway reservation booth,
            at which we have to get into the reservation queue. <br> New customers got into the queue
            from the rear end, whereas the customers who get their seats reserved leave the queue
            from the front end.</p>
            <p><span>Another example:-</span>In a resturant first come first served</p>
            <img src="Queue.png" alt="" height="120px" width="300px">
            <br>
            <p>The process to add element into queue is called Enqueue and the process of removing a element in a queue called Dequeue</p>
            <h2>Operations in queue</h2>
            <li>Enqueue:This operation adds an element to back of the queue</li>
            <li>Dequeue: This operation removes an element from the front of the queue</li>
            <li>Peek: This operation returns the value of the element at front of the queue without removing it</li>
            <li>Isempty: This operation checks of the queue is empty</li>
            <li>Isfull: this operation checks of the queue is full</li>
            <h2>Types of Queue</h2>
            <ol>There are four types of queue
                <li>Simple Queue</li>
                <li>Circular Queue</li>
                <li>Dequeue (Double ended Queue)</li>
                <li>Priority Queue</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Simple queue is covered read just the the previous paragraphs</p>
        <h4>Circular Queue:</h4>
