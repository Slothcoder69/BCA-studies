    <h2>Queue</h2>
    <p><span>Queue:</span>Is a non-primitive linear data structure that permits insertion of an element at one end and deletion of an element at other end. <br>
        The end at which the deletion of an
        element take place is called <span>front</span>, <br> and the end at which insertion of a new element can
        take place is called <span>rear</span></p>
        <p>The first element that gets added into the queue is the first one to get removed from the list. <br> Hence, Queue is also referred to as <span>First-In-First-Out (FIFO)</span></p>
        <p><span>Real life example</span>The name
            ‘Queue’ comes from the everyday use of the term. Consider a railway reservation booth,
            at which we have to get into the reservation queue. <br> New customers got into the queue
            from the rear end, whereas the customers who get their seats reserved leave the queue
            from the front end.</p>
            <p><span>Another example:-</span>In a resturant first come first served</p>
            <img src="Queue.png" alt="" height="120px" width="300px">
            <br>
            <p>The process to add element into queue is called Enqueue and the process of removing a element in a queue called Dequeue</p>
            <h2>Operations in queue</h2>
            <li>Enqueue:This operation adds an element to back of the queue</li>
            <li>Dequeue: This operation removes an element from the front of the queue</li>
            <li>Peek: This operation returns the value of the element at front of the queue without removing it</li>
            <li>Isempty: This operation checks of the queue is empty</li>
            <li>Isfull: this operation checks of the queue is full</li>
            <h2>Types of Queue</h2>
            <ol>There are four types of queue
                <li>Simple Queue</li>
                <li>Circular Queue</li>
                <li>Dequeue (Double ended Queue)</li>
                <li>Priority Queue</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Simple queue is covered read just the the previous paragraphs</p>
    <p> <span style="color: blue;">Circular Queue:</span> The simple queue has a drawback where, if the array is not full, it is still considered <br> full due to the rear pointer reaching the end <br> <li>This issue can be addressed by using a circular queue, where the rear pointer can wrap around to the beginning of the array <br> when it reaches the end, effectively utilizing all available space.</li></p>
            <ol style="font-size: 18px ">Advantages of Circular Queue:
                <li>It provides a quick way to store FIFO data with a maximum size.</li>
                <li>Efficient utilization of the memory.</li>
                <li>Doesn't use dynamic memory.</li>
                <li>Simple implementation.</li>
                <li>All operations occur in O(1) constant time.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span style="color: blue;">Dequeue:-</span>The word dequeue is a short form of double-ended queue. It is pronounced as deck. <br> Dequeue defines a data structure where elements can be added or deleted at either the fron end or rear end, but no changes can be made elsewhere in the list. <br>The dequeue is a generalisation of both a stack and a queue</p><img src="dequeue.png" alt="">
            <ol>The four operation associated with dequeue
                <li><span>Enqueue Front:</span> adds element at the front end of the queue</li>
                <li><span>Enqueue Rear:</span> adds element at the rear end of the queue</li>
               <li><span>Dequeue Front:</span> deletes element at the front end of the queue.</li>
                <li><span>Dequeue Rear:</span>deletes element at the rear end of the queue</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span style="color: blue;">Priority  Queue: </span>A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements based on their priority values. <br>Elements with higher priority values are typically retrieved before elements with lower priority values. <br>In a priority queue, each element has a priority value associated with it.</p> <br><br> <img src="priorty queue.png" alt="">
