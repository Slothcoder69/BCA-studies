        <dl>

            <dt>OOP : </dt>
            <dd> Object oriented programming is a programming model in which we write programs using classes and objects
                utilising features of oops</dd>
                <dd>Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes. Each object can also contain its own procedures or methods</dd>
        </dl>
    </table>
    <h3>Some basic concepts of OOPs are:</h3>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>Objects</li>
    <li>Data abstraction and encapsulation</li>
    <li>Inheritance</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
    <li>Dynamic binding</li>
    <li>Message passing</li>
    <table class="define">
        <dl>
            <dt>Class:</dt>
            <dd>Collection of object is called class</dd>
            <dd>A class in C++ is a user-defined data type that has data members and member functions</dd>
            <dd>A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.</dd><br>
            <a href="class.png" class="img-link">click here for program</a><br>
            <dt>Object:</dt>
            <dd>Anything that exists physically in real world
            <dd>In C++, an object is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint that defines the data and behavior
                of an object.
            </dd>
            <dd> An object is a self-contained entity that contains both data and functions. It is a runtime entity, it
                is created at runtime.</dd>
            </dd>
            <dt>Inheritance:</dt>
            <dd>Properties of one class can be inherited to others</dd>
            <dd>There are several types of inheritance:</dd>
            <li>Single Inheritance:
                In single inheritance, a class inherits from only one base class.</li>
            <li>Multiple Inheritance:
                In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one base class.</li>
            <li>Multilevel Inheritance:
                In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from another class, and then a new class is derived from it.</li>
            <dt>Polymorphism</dt>
            <dd>It is ability to exist in more than 1 form</dd>
            <dd>Polymorphism is one of the main features of object-oriented programming. It allows us to reuse code by creating one function that's usable for multiple uses</dd>
            <dd>We can also make operators polymorphic and use them to add not only numbers but also combine strings.</dd>
            <dt>Abstraction</dt>
            <dd>Hiding internal details and showing functionality to user</dd>
            <dd> This can be done by using access modifiers, such as private and protected, to control which members of a class can be accessed from outside the class.</dd>
            <dt>Encapsulation</dt>
            <dd>Binding of code and data together in a single unit</dd>
            <dt>Dynmaic binding</dt>
            <dd>Dynamic binding, also known as late binding, is a mechanism in C++ that allows you to call a different function depending on the type of object that is being used.</dd>
            <dd>Which code will execute is unknown until the program runs</dd>
            <dt>Message passing</dt>
            <dd>Objects communicate with each other by sending and receving information</dd>
        </dl>

    <h3>Benefits of OOP
    </h3>
    <li>Written code can be reused using objects and inheritance</li>
    <li> to its ability to hide certain programs, It helps to build a secure system </li>
    <li>Productivity :-OOP provides improved software development productivity over traditional procedural programming because of its modularity, extensibility, and reusability.</li>
    <li>It is much easier to modify and maintain the program</li>
    <li>Problems solving:- OOP helps programmers solve the issue without going through each and every line of the entire code. It helps in breaking the program into smaller problems and solving one error at a time.</li>
    <h3>DISADVANTAGES OF OOPS</h3>
    <li>It requires more data protection</li>
    <li>Inadequate for concurrent problems</li>
    <li>OOP can add complexity to your world</li>
    <li>Limited reusability</li>
    <li>Programs developed in oop are much larger than procedural approach</li>
    <li>OOP is not a universal language , so it can't be applied everywhere</li>
