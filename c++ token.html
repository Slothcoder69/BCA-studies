<h2>Tokens in c++ are the smallest individual element that is meaningful to the compiler
</h2>
<ul>The tokens are classified into:
    <li>Keywords</li>
    <li>Identifiers</li>
    <li>literals</li>
    <li>Punctuators/ seperators</li>
    <li>Operator</li>
    <dl>
        <dt>Keywords</dt><dd>These are reserved words that have a specific meaning in the language, such as int, float, while, and if.</dd>
        <dt>Identifiers</dt><dd>These are names given to variables,function or ther objects in code</dd>
        <dt>Operator</dt><dd>These are symbols to represent such as +,-,* and/</dd>
        <dt>Punctuators</dt><dd>There are symbols that are used ot seperate tokens such as (,), ;, and ,</dd>
        <dt>Literals</dt><dd>Literals in C++ are data that represent fixed values. They can be used directly in the code without being assigned to a variable. Literals cannot be changed once they are created.</dd>
           <dd> There are five types of literals in C++:</dd>
            <dd>Integer literals: represent whole numbers, such as 10, 25, and -30.</dd>
            <dd>Floating-point literals: represent numbers with decimal points, such as 3.14159 and -2.71828.</dd>
            <dd>Character literals: represent single characters, such as 'a', 'B', and '$'</dd>
            <dd>String literals: represent sequences of characters, such as "Hello, world!" and "This is a string.".</dd>
            <dd>Boolean literals: represent true or false values, such as true and false. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Tokens are usually separated by white space, which can be one or more blanks, tabs, or newlines. The C++ standard specifies a basic source character set that may be used in source files.</p>
